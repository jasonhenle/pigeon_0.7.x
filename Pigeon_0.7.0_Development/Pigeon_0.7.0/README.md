## Protocols (plain English)

- **App state protocol:** saved devices, locations, and delegation state are persisted through `pigeonSystem/pigeon/app_state.py`.
- **Image UI protocol:** layout/compositing rules for overlays, logos, and background content are handled in `pigeonSystem/pigeon/image_ui_protocol.py`.
- **Widget protocol:** widget behavior contracts and shell integration live in `pigeonSystem/pigeon/widget_protocol.py` and `pigeonSystem/pigeon/widget_shell.py`.
- **Device delegation protocol:** feature capability fallback/ordering and advanced matrix behavior are driven by `pigeonSystem/device_capability_matrix.py`, `pigeonSystem/settings_advanced_matrix.py`, and app-state delegation logs.
- **TMDB fetch protocol:** query generation, retries, and artwork preparation flow through `pigeonSystem/pigeon/tmdb_poster.py` plus retry logging.
- **Startup protocol:** splash animation starts first, then visualizer startup choreography runs (float on -> flap -> ascend -> soar -> float off).

## UI views

- **View 1 (Pigeon main):** main UI composition with backdrop/title/logo/clock/status behaviors.
- **View 2 (Visualizer):** mic visualizer-focused mode.
- **View 3 (Clock):** dedicated time/date emphasis.
- **View 4 (Debug):** plain layout with raw title debug text.
- **View 5 (Grid):** design grid overlay for alignment/tuning.
- **Settings panel:** device setup, TMDB controls, reset/debug tools, and build version at footer.
